            <h2>Story 2</h2>
            <p>A man meets another in the street both with years of stories and expirience
                if they talked they could do so for hours, but they don't even make eye contact;
                it's not worth the risk of betrayal. For most people aren't good enough to be taken on faith alone.

            <h2>Story 3</h2>
            <p>A fox catches a rabit in it's mouth the rabbit screams "please I am pregnant!!! just let me give birth to
                this litter
                in a few days and I will let you eat me then" the fox replies "ok direct me to your den and I will leave
                you there and
                then come back in a few days after your children can survive on their own" "THANK YOU" screams the
                Rabbit
                the fox drops the rabbit off. A week or two later the fox returns to the Rabbits den. Once again
                the Rabbit thanks the fox emensely "thank you for having a little kindness in this terrible game of
                life"
                the fox replies "this world is cold enough I just wanted to make it a little warmer, can I see the life
                that can exist as a result of my kindness?"
                "Of course!!!"" exclaimed the Rabbit. The Rabbit brings the fox to the children he has allowed to live
                on good faith
                also showing him extra food she has collected for him. The fox tells the Rabbit her children are
                beutiful creations.
                And thanks her for the extra food as it was not a part of the deal. Then the fox gives the Rabbit an odd
                stare and she knows it's time.
                But then, the fox devours the children 1 by one has the Rabbit screams in desperation and agony. After
                he finishes the children he looks
                at the Rabbit and says "a deals a deal, I brought you back to your den and waited two weeks now you must
                let me eat you"
                the Rabbit lies there defeated and lacking any drive to live. The fox proceeds to eat the Rabbit, but as
                the fox leaves the cave
                he stops and drops dead. Turns out niether side had any intentions of holding up their end of the deal;
                the Rabbit had injested
                poisonus berries the moment she saw the fox arrive.
